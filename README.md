# TSV TN Cleanup & Quote Converter App

A web application for converting and cleaning up Translation Notes (TN) TSV files, specifically designed to work with Door43 Content Service (DCS) repositories.

## What it does

This app helps translators and editors process Translation Notes TSV files by:

1. **Fetching TSV files** from git.door43.org by selecting a Bible book and branch, or by pasting/uploading content directly
2. **Converting quotes** from English (ULT) to original language (Greek/Hebrew)
3. **Standardizing quotes** by converting to English and back to original languages
4. **Merging with DCS** to combine your rows with the full TN file from the repository
5. **Creating GL Quote columns** with English text from the Quote field
6. **Converting straight quotes** to curly quotes for proper typography

## Features

### Input Options

- **Paste text** directly from clipboard
- **Upload TSV file** from your computer
- **Fetch from DCS** - automatically downloads the TN file for your selected book and branch

### Conversion Options

The app provides several checkbox options for processing:

1. **Convert English (ULT) quotes to Greek/Hebrew** in the `Quote` field
2. **Standardize/Fix all Quotes** by converting to English and then back to Greek/Hebrew
3. **Merge with the full TN file from DCS** and copy to clipboard to paste to DCS
4. **Create GL Quote and Occurrence columns** with the English from the Quote field
5. **Convert all single/double straight quotes** to curly quotes

### Display Features

The converted results are shown in a paginated table with filtering options:

- **Show only converted rows** - displays only the rows you provided
- **Show only changed rows** - highlights rows that were modified during conversion
- **Show only QUOTE_NOT_FOUND rows** - filters to show rows where quotes couldn't be converted
- **Diff highlighting** - yellow highlighting shows differences, red shows errors

### DCS Integration

- **Copy to clipboard** - copies the converted TSV content for manual pasting
- **Paste into DCS Editor** - copies content and opens the DCS file editor in a new window
- **Direct DCS links** - provides links to view the source files on DCS
